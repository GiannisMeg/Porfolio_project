## Welcome to FridayShakes.

This is an App made as part of my final Project as a Student in Coddaiseur Coding BootCamp.
This is a project made in 10 days from scratch using no templates or previous code.

## The idea behind ; 

The need in the market for an easy to use Events App has never been bigger.
I know that from experience and since now i have the tools i took the liberty to start a small revolution by making a new easy to use, friendly and FREE App for small Bars and Breweries.
